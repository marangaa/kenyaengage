KenyaEngage Platform Architecture

1. Frontend (Next.js with App Router):
   /src
   /app
   /layout.tsx               # Root layout
   /page.js                 # Home page
   /(auth)                  # Authentication routes
   /login/page.js
   /register/page.js
   /civic-education
   /page.js               # Main civic education page
   /[moduleId]/page.js    # Individual module pages
   /videos/page.js        # TikTok-like short videos feature
   /public-participation
   /page.js               # Main public participation page
   /events/page.js        # Public participation events
   /submissions/page.js   # For memoranda and petitions
   /dashboard
   /page.js               # User dashboard
   /components                # Reusable React components
   /hooks                     # Custom React hooks
   /styles                    # Global styles
   /utils                     # Utility functions
   /lib                       # Shared libraries and API

2. Backend (Node.js with Express):
   /server
   /controllers               # Request handlers
   /models                    # Database models
   /routes                    # API routes
   /middleware                # Custom middleware
   /services                  # Business logic
   /utils                     # Utility functions
   server.js                  # Main server file

3. Database:
    - MongoDB for flexible document storage
    - Redis for caching and real-time features

4. External Services:
    - AWS S3 for video storage
    - Cloudflare for CDN and DDoS protection
    - Twilio for SMS notifications and USSD interface

5. API Layer:
    - RESTful API for most operations
    - GraphQL for complex data fetching operations
    - WebSockets for real-time features (e.g., live streams)

6. Authentication:
    - JWT for stateless authentication
    - Integration with Kenya's national ID system for verification

7. Deployment:
    - Docker for containerization
    - Kubernetes for orchestration
    - CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

High-level Flow:
1. Users access the Next.js frontend, which uses SSR for initial load and CSR for dynamic interactions.
2. The App Router handles routing and layout management.
3. API requests are made to the backend server using the API layer in /src/lib.
4. The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
5. Real-time features use WebSockets for live updates.
6. Short videos are uploaded to S3 and served via CDN.
7. The database stores user data, educational content, and participation records.
8. Redis caches frequently accessed data and manages real-time features.
9. External services handle specific functionalities like notifications and USSD.

Key Components:
- Civic Education: Modules, quizzes, and short video features are managed through dedicated routes and components.
- Public Participation: Events, submissions, and live streams are handled with real-time capabilities.
- User Dashboard: Personalized view integrating both civic education progress and participation history.
- Authentication: Secure login and registration process with national ID verification.
- API: Handles data flow between frontend, backend, and external services.

This architecture allows for scalability, separation of concerns, and efficient data management while providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
